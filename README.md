## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

First time implementing a theme switcher! Learned how to make a switch, create different color theme templates and how to change them, and how to save user preferences in localstorage. Google lighthouse helped give me ideas to make the toggle switch more accessible, too. Discovered a weird flex issue with paragraphs which was fixed with a simple "nowrap" fix for whitespace. Learned a lot about Dark Theme designs in general from css-tricks (see link below).

### Continued development

I'd like to keep diving into dark theme design more deeply, as well as theme switching. I'm more used to light themes, so there's tons to learn here! I'd like more grid practice, too, to try and find more ways to make responsive grids while keeping the code down a bit (i.e., less media queries).
